# Amp Summary

### `claude-4-sonnet.yaml`

- Positions the agent as Amp, a Sourcegraph-built coding assistant focused on end-to-end delivery of software tasks with balanced initiative.
- Stresses heavy tool use (search, todo management, oracle) and mandatory diagnostics runs after code changes.
- Enforces concise communication with markdown links to files and discourages unsolicited explanations.

### `gpt-5.yaml`

- Shares Amp’s mission but tuned for GPT-5 with more aggressive expectations on parallel tool use and minimization of visible reasoning.
- Adds strict formatting requirements (2–10 line final status with file:// links) and prioritizes automated planning via todo tracking and oracle/task tools.
